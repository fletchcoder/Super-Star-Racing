# Super Star Racing

Super Star Racing is a racing project built to showcase React functionality, particularly useState and useEffect. The project is a game that allows users to pit two vehicles against each other that will race to the right side of the screen where the finish line awaits. After the game finishes, the user will be told the result of the race and will be prompted to play the game again or simply close the result screen window.
